# Bindery region sim arena report

Results are from the bindery region simulator with the approximate `bindery-sim-approx` rules, not retail RA2; they are directional.
The arm is a full `BotRuntime`. Opponents named `ai-*` are the independent scripted AI (`Bindery.Ra2.Bot.Sim.Opponents`, no shared planner code; `:easy`/`:medium`/`:hard`, default hard); the other opponents are pinned-playbook styles running a frozen copy of the bot's stack as of commit 7f3e2c7 (`Bindery.Ra2.Bot.Baseline`), a stationary benchmark; `live-<style>` runs a pinned style on the live stack. The arm plays Allied on odd seeds and Soviet on even seeds. Match limit 1200 s (a timeout is won on final asset value).
Opponents are split as well as maps. Held-out opponents (`ai-horde`, `ai-armor`, independent scripted styles) are never used for the selector's default playbook, bandit learning, distillation datasets or tuning; see "Held-out opponents" below. They are not untouched: their difficulty and the contested benchmark's handicaps were calibrated against the selector's win rate on all five maps, held-out maps included, so the selector's own held-out win rate is near one half partly by construction. Every other opponent is a training opponent: the selector's default playbook was chosen from a style-versus-style matrix against the pinned-playbook styles (training maps only), so win rates against training opponents are partly in-sample.
Benchmark: contested (opponent income ×1, Allied income ×1, Allied starting credits 20000, opponent starting credits default, combat noise ±0.25).

Matches: 4

## Win rate (arm × split)

Distinct games drop repeats of an identical game (same arm faction, decision log and outcome on the same map): against a differently named opponent whose style had not diverged when the match ended, or on another seed that changed nothing; the distinct interval is the one to read. The arm plays Allied on odd seeds and Soviet on even seeds, and starts west on seeds 1-2, 5-6, ... and east on 3-4, 7-8, ...; the fixture is asymmetric, so the faction and side columns show the mix behind each rate.

| Arm | Split | Wins | Losses | Draws | Matches | Win rate | 95% interval (Wilson) | Distinct games | Distinct wins | 95% interval, distinct | As Allied | As Soviet | As west | As east | Eliminations won | Timeouts |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| selector | heldout | 3 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 0.750 | [0.301, 0.954] | 4 | 3 | [0.301, 0.954] | 1/2 | 2/2 | 3/4 | 0/0 | 3 | 1 |

Warning: the start-side mix is unbalanced for selector/heldout (4 west, 0 east); a map-side advantage leaks into the rate. Use a multiple of 4 for `--seeds`.

Benchmark check: the baseline `selector` scored 0.750 over 4 matches, outside the 30–70% band: the benchmark is saturated and win-rate comparisons carry little information (use `--benchmark contested`).

## Win rate by opponent style

| Arm | Split | ai-horde:medium |
|---|---|---|
| selector | heldout | 3/4 |

## Held-out opponents

Opponent split × map split. Held-out opponents never inform the selector's defaults, bandit learning (the arena abandons the bandit's episode instead of crediting it, as it does on held-out maps), distillation datasets or teacher runs, or tuning (the tuner refuses them); their difficulty was calibrated against the selector on all maps, so read the selector's own held-out rate as partly calibrated and other arms' rates relative to it.

| Arm | Opponents | Maps | Wins | Losses | Draws | Matches | Win rate | 95% interval (Wilson) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| selector | heldout | heldout | 3 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 0.750 | [0.301, 0.954] |
| selector | heldout | all | 3 | 1 | 0 | 4 | 0.750 | [0.301, 0.954] |

## Economy, production and combat (arm side, per-match averages)

Production idle: seconds with a factory, nothing queued and credits for the cheapest item, over match seconds. Trade efficiency: enemy value destroyed in combat / own value lost in combat (pooled over matches).

Time to first attack: first second a combat unit stood in a region holding an enemy structure (mean over matches where it happened; count in brackets).

| Arm | Duration s | Units built | Buildings built | Peak army value | Idle fraction | Avg credits | Final assets (arm / opp) | Trade efficiency | First attack s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| selector | 758 | 65.0 | 13.0 | 3950 | 0.005 | 12521 | 31925 / 14275 | 0.95 (58500/61800) | 172 (4/4) |

## Strategy layer (arm side)

Proposals, invalid plans and lateness are the arm's primary strategist's: rejected / proposals; seconds from a proposal's snapshot to its validation; late-discard count / proposals. Fallback and emergency proposals (immediate and always valid) are counted apart so they cannot flatter the strategist under test. Shadow columns are the shadow strategist's own lateness and would-be invalid plans. Churn: activations and posture flips per 10 game minutes.

Shadow agreement: shadow proposals naming the same playbook as the primary proposal for the same request / shadow proposals whose request got a primary proposal.

| Arm | Proposals | Invalid plans | Mean lateness s | Late-discarded | Fallback proposals | Failed requests | Shadow proposals | Shadow invalid | Shadow mean lateness s | Shadow agreement | Activations /10 min | Posture flips /10 min |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| selector | 167 | 0/167 (0.000) | 0.00 | 0/167 (0.000) | 0 | 0 | 0 | n/a | n/a | n/a | 1.39 | 0.40 |

## Command gate and simulator rejections (arm side, totals)

- **selector**: 0 dropped by the gate (none); 14 commands rejected by the simulator.

## Inference cost (arm side)

- **selector** (no model): 0 in / 0 out tokens and $0.0000 per match, of which $0.0000 on failed requests.

## Hidden-information leakage

- **selector**: 0 validator `fog.*` rejections.

Probe: two lockstep simulations, hidden state of one perturbed (`SimLeakageProbe`: enemy credits and queue, wounded hidden enemies, a hidden unit in an unseen region, one announced there through the event path, and one just across a border inside the arm's weapon reach), strategist-context hash compared on every following frame until the window closes or the objects the arm can see first differ. A differing frame is one where the context changed while everything visible was still identical. Fog-violation frames are arm frames, over the whole run of both simulations, that carried an enemy object or event from a region the arm did not see: a per-frame check that finds leaks the perturbation does not exercise.

| Arm | Map | Seed | Perturbed at s | Lockstep before | Compared s | Differing frames | Fog-violation frames | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| selector | open-steppe | 1 | 90 | yes | 45 | 0/671 | 0 | stopped at 135 s: the arm saw a legitimate difference |
| selector | open-steppe | 1 | 240 | yes | 0 | 0/1 | 0 | stopped at 240 s: the arm saw a legitimate difference |
